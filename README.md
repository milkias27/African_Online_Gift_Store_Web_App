# African_Online_Gift_Store_Web_App
A Repository for Online African Gift Store Web APP


This is online gift store project. It will be a web-based application which primarily focuses in buying/selling non-local artistic or handmade gifts and eventually I would like it to grow in to selling, buying platform and advertising artistic products.

This web application is intended to address the following problems. 
1.	To let people, buy gifts that are not locally available and hard to find them online since certain kind of artistic and handmade gifts are only available in the countries they are produced. 
2.	I would like this platform to eventually grow to let artists sell and do advertisement of their products. 

The backend of this online gift store webapp is php. Php will be leveraged used to add products to cart and searching functionality, calculate total price of items in the cart.  All other CRUD functionality when adding products to the system by and administrator, user registration will also be achieved by php interaction with the MySQL database.
